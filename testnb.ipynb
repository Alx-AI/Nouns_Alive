    "Who We Are\n",
    "We are a community of Nounish builders setting out to create a Daily Celebration of Noun O’ Clock called The Noun Square, administered by a Nouncil-like body and with the goal of proliferating Nouns by turning Noun O’ Clock into a “Shared Moment” for the entire Internet. We have successfully completed two week pilot using a combination of Small Grants and out-of-pocket funds for prizes (data from which which has informed this proposal)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our vision\n",
    "For anyone who grew up in the 70s, 80s or 90s, “The Price is Right” holds a special place in our collective psyche. For over 50 years, its daily blend of ritual and play has entertained hundreds of thousands of people the world over. We believe Noun O’ Clock can recreate this kind of shared experience for web3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broad Goals:\n",
    "Turn NOC into a daily shared global moment - develop a grass-root, organic, daily show that introduces more people to nouns & its thriving community & sub-communities. As well as creates a space in which our growing community can meet daily and share a live moment together.\n",
    "Model our community on Nouncil - a collective of builders all over the globe with varied skillsets, collaborating to organize and administer a daily Twitter Spaces. We think that a decentralized community model can be the nounish way to scale a Noun O' Clock show!\n",
    "Be consistent (”one NOC, every day, forever”) - Even in the deep NOC winter, we believe consistency is key to cementing NOC as a daily celebration for the Internet. We are planning ahead for this with hosts from all over the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The (Current) Format\n",
    "Begin 15 min before NOC every day.\n",
    "Contest review & announcements.\n",
    "Casual guest interview while watching/discussing end of daily Noun auction.\n",
    "Play FOMO Live together (we invite as many attendees as possible to come on stage and keep mics open for an interactive experience.)\n",
    "Give live Secret Word for those who wish to collect POAP for attendance.\n",
    "*On weekends, we run a LITE version of The Noun Square featring only FOMO live, hosted by a different nounish community every Saturday (e.g. Lil Nouns and GOOP DAO the past two weeks, future guest hosts Nouns DAO Japan, Korean Noun Fans, NounPunks, FloriNouns, etc.)\n",

    "Growing Discord Community\n",
    "\n",
    "Growing the community\n",
    "We want to grow the community and build in the open. We have created a Discord server open to anyone who wants to contribute. We have also created a public Google Sheet that tracks our progress and metrics and future plans for anyone to follow along.\n",
    "Hosting a live Spaces every day is an audacious goal (albeit one we are excited about), and will require participation and help from Nounsfolk in all timezones, especially as NOC drifts into the North American Night.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compensation Model\n",
    "Our ask for the next 30 days is 55 ETH:\n",
    "Contest rewards (0.5 eth/day * 20 weekdays = 10 ETH)\n",
    "We will experiment with these numbers and the cadence of them as we move forward, but so far this amount and cadence has produced excellent participation.\n",
    "Team reward + operations (see budget below): 45 ETH\n",
    "Because we intend to build this initiative as a community effort, we will be modeling our team reward, at least for the first period, on Nouncil’s proven model of a Coordinape round, where all active participants will allocate tokens based on contributions.** We think this will ultimately be a fairer and more frictionless way of properly rewarding the team than attempting to itemize every hour of effort, etc.\n",
    "Based on our pilot, we estimated how many man-hours it takes to run a show like this every day. We think these are reasonable overall estimates.\n",

    "Twitter analytics\n",
    "Massive reach within 14 days!\n",
    " \n",
    "Gamifying NOC with POAPs\n",
    "We are using POAPs to gamify NOC and create both engagement and loyalty. We feel that our use of Daily Attendance POAPs is the purest use case for the tech (literally “Proof of Attendance”) and we want to use them to incentivize people to attend Noun O’ Clock every single day if they can.\n",
    "So far, it’s working! Ser Noadz has been creating amazing daily animated POAPs based on the new Noun of the Day and would continue to do so for the first month (after which we would explore other “Series” by other Nounish artists.)\n",
    " \n",
    "We also want to experiment with doing bonuses like physical Merch drops for those with provable streaks of attendance, and raffles that are easier to win the more times you have attended.\n",
    "Example Possible “The Noun Square” Merch Drop for Attendance Streaks:\n",
    " \n",
    "Playing FOMO\n",
    "The peak moment of The Noun Square is, of course, playing FOMO live and minting a new Noun together. When FOMO starts during the Twitter Space, we ask all speakers to unmute and speak their mind, to create as much chaos, interaction and fun as possible. The feedback so far has been that people have been loving it!\n",
    "We have noticed anecdotally that FOMO seems to take longer on average with more players, until we hit that beautiful noun that reaches some consensus. We think the Nouns minted over the past week or so are especially legendary, and believe it’s related to our efforts to gamify FOMO and bring in new players.\n",
    "The impressive roster of Nouns minted by FOMO since we started:\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Potential challenges\n",
    "1.\tJuly gets into very late night EST and we may have fewer participants. However, we believe that consistency is key, as well as the opportunity to get more people from non-north america timezones to hear about nouns.\n",
    "2.\tOver-saturation is a risk of course, as with anything that happens daily. But as with The Price is Right, we hope to create a shared ritual with the community we are building, such that the daily show is something they look forward to, rather than a chore they get bored of. We are building variety into the structure of the show, with a mixture of weekly segments and novel guests and contests to keep things interesting for many, many months (and hopefully longer!)\n",
    "In Conclusion:\n",
    "Over the past two weeks, we have kicked off a tradition of making Noun O’ Clock a daily celebration, featuring live Twitter Spaces, interactive contests and special guests. So far, people love it. (See feedback section below)\n",
    "We believe that, if given funding to execute our vision detailed here, we can bring new attention to Nouns and the daily auction every day, while also supporting extension and sub-DAO communities, and engaging active Nounish builders.\n",
    "Let’s work together to make Noun O’ Clock into a shared moment for the Internet!\n",
