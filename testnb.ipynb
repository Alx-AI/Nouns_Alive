    "After completing a succesful pilot we can expand the Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscription to 3,000 Kids for $300,000\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition we can pilot a Nounish Vision Van Program with Sergul Ezurum, MD, founder of Sight For All United who will spearhead this initiative in parternship with Vision To Learn. Together we will create a high tech, Nounish Vision Van Program and execute a years worth of exams covering 3-4,000 kids for $250,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*there might be some overlap between NxFF Subscription Prescriptions and Sight For All United's program but they are not inclusive of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recap: Prop 12: Nouns x Fitz Frames Free Glasses For Kids v2:\n",
    "Nouns x Fitz Free Glasses For Kids v2 was a huge success. We were able to visit 3 schools, complete 355 eye exams and dispense subscriptions for 285 kids in need, delivering a total of 391 custom fitted 3D printed Fitz Frames glasses to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "We spent a significant effort developing Noun Frames which inspired other builders and led the way for FUN Frames and Fashion Frames to move into development.\n",

    "Continuing our partnership with Fitz Frames & partnering with various vision screening and testing providers we will deliver 3,000 Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscription, which provides free glasses for kids if they lose them, break them, grow out of them or just desires a new pair because their style changed, will be expanded to 3K kids. Using a propriatery in-app measurement and delivery system Fitz Frames removes the need for in-person fittings and shapings that require specialized equipment and gets the perfect custom fit 3D printed glasses for kids individual face shape and personal style. Our goal is to keep kids in glasses that fit and they're proud to wear, even as they change throughout the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding the scale of this program will get us one step closer to our moon shot of creating a system where individual doctors around the world can plug in to and get free glasses for kids in need through the Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscription program.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a pivot from a Nationwide Sponsorship for Vision To Learn we have the opportunity to work hand in hand with Sight For All United on launching a new Vision Van Program complete with a brand new van that we can collaborate together on to make it as Nounish as possible. This will allow us to peek under the hood, literally, at how Vision To Learn works and the impact these programs deliver to communities where they are available.\n",
